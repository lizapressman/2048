CSC 172 Project 1 (2048):
	My implementation of 2048 uses an Applet, KeyListener, and MouseListener. 
	Applet parameters should be set to a width of 575 and height of 680!!!
	The keys consist of all four arrows as explained in the comments in the code
		Arrow keys are used to move the tiles
	There are four "buttons" that the player can click.
		The first two are the quit and restart buttons
		The next two are the yes and no buttons to confirm quitting
	Despite having buttons for these four actions, because the assignment requested the use of q and r (to quit and restart), I have also implemented those keys to work (along with y(yes) and n(no)).
	I have also made the "wasd" keys work for movement as well as that was how the assignment requested to move.
